# Image-Classification-using-CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks come under the subdomain of Machine Learning which is Deep Learning.
Algorithms under Deep Learning process information the same way the human brain does, but obviously on a very small scale,
since our brain is too complex (our brain has around 86 billion neurons).

The model has been trained on pre-existing model Xception and the final layers have been changed by using method of transfer learning
to be able for classifying 4 categories (Cats, Dogs, Fishes and Flowers).

The website has been hosted on Streamlit App where user needs to provide URL of Image for Classification. Sample outputs
are present below for reference.

Future scopes include classification of categories during live videos. This is helpful even for Object Recognition.
