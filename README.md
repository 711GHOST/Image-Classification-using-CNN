# Image-Classification-using-CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks come under the subdomain of Machine Learning which is Deep Learning.
Algorithms under Deep Learning process information the same way the human brain does, but obviously on a very small scale,
since our brain is too complex (our brain has around 86 billion neurons).
